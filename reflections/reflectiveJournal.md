 ## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
 Scratch is a high- level block-based visual programming langauge that we used for intro to programming. This was developed by MIT.

### What is visual programming?
It is language that allows us to describe processes through illustrations. It could be 2D or 3D in context, containing text, symbols and icons.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
When I was making some projects on scratch:
It's difficult to delete code that you lovingly picked and nurtured and spent time with like it's your child. But have to delete to make way for the better code that would actually let your code run properly.
Had to learn that code runs immediately, needs to code in the timing and loops so they dont run simultaneously.
 When you can visually see what the code changes and there's already a set of functions that you can choose from, it's easier to focus on learning the concepts and principles instead of the actual code. It's great for beginners to familiarise and explore using a VPL.


### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
 My ghost click game

  If you click on the moving ghost, you will get a higher score and the ghost will change colour. There is no end point but can reset the game using the green flag. Code is included to make sure that the score will reset to 0 after pressing the green flag.
 
 My Hello World project. I think no one got the reference I made to an Alien saying Hello World and teleporting to said World from outer space but that's ok.

 <!--- I hid some of the embed code just in case of my Scratch projects--->
 
 I also have a private project that I used to learn more components inside scratch where scratch is trying to become the next american idol by trying to catch the microphone.
And an adventure game inspired mini-project where scratch and a ghost character are teleporting between locations which makes the ghost sprite go crazy in a perpetual loop.

 
 ## Week 2:

### What is git?
 Git is a DevOps tool for source code management where you can track code and enable multiple users to work together. A local high quality version control system.
 

### What is GitHub?
 Github is a git repository hosting service that is cloud based where you can share code.
 

 <dd>This week I learned how to fork a repository and as a class we worked on a mural 

 main->initial commit->new things->add some button/new things->remove some error->and if app is working fine: release
 </dd>

 
Week 3 (sarmad.py)
------
 This week we had to learn to run code in visual studio. including how to download the extension for Python and the interpreter.
 
 I learned about different types: integers, floats and strings
 
 This week was really crucial to learn how to keep track and document code. Using # to keep track of what steps need to be done or was done or what potential issue. And how to save the files into our one drive so it doesn't disappear.
 
 We also learned about the Krebs cycle of creativity. Art->Science->Engineering->Design

Week 4
-------
 Participating in the videograph. We were tasked with creating art as a team.
 
 
 
# Questions
 
 
 
 
### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
 At first I would maybe take a short lunch break for the entire day. I had to actively start telling myself to rest my eyes after an hour or so and to drink something, also started standing up every now and then to stretch my arms and legs really recently.
 

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
 Timeboxing is an agile principle when you allocate a fixed unit of time to an activity, which is called a timebox. I have used it for study time every single exam time since high school but I have never heard of the term before. I used a hybrid with a checklist style during uni. I found out that being too specific is worse for me. So for example, instead of assigning every few minutes with tasks, I allocate 4 hours to an activity, and all the tasks will be in a checklist. I try to tick off as many items in that list within that 4 hour timebox in no specific order. I think it's not possible to know exactly how long anything would take for every single task and it leads to stress. This way it has flexibility.
 

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
 I would say a 3. I don't have much of a computer background but I do have some stats background that comes in handy sometimes. I think the next assignment is really interesting, so even though I can't follow as fast or produce as much code, it's easier to keep going because it's fun.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
 I'm really proud of my scratch projects. I think I'm a visual person and I like seeing things move around and figuring things out more than seeing my code actually run.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
 My personal learning strategy when it comes to code is to follow along as much as I can in real time and then figure things out on my own before asking for help so I understand what's going on when I do get help. I also really need to figure out how to document everything I've done including my notes and code to see my progress and what else I need to work on in my spare time. I think I'll buy a planner and write notes on what I worked on and colour code where I can find them like "personal computer" or "school computer" or "printout".


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
 I think I would tell myself to 
 > make time to make more connections in class and to look at the readings before it gets busy. 
 
Now, I have to live with the regret that no one noticed I'm actually kinda funny...

### What is Python?
 Python is a high level programming language developed by Rossum and implemented in 1989, Rossum is a big fan of Monty Python.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
 Already explore all the time, now the problem is just lack of time.

### Have you meditated before?
 Used to meditate every night using Headspace but now it's not free anymore. Now I just practise mindfulness.

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
 ~~Please don't call out my Candy Crush addiction right now.~~ I got to higher levels because I played Candy Crush every single day. Even when it got harder and new candy was introduced, I used the skills I already developed to tackle each new level. But at the cost of my dignity.
 

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
 No, not yet, I have so much basic stuff to learn but I will get there.

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
 How do you solve anything without creativity? When there is a problem and we only have a set amount of resources, you just have to be creative. Also, I think you need to be able to explore ideas that might not seem logical because, in the end, if it works, it was the logical answer afterall.
 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
 22 tabs in 4 windows. All for study purposes. Distraction related tabs are put in a "open later" bookmark folder so that my laptop doesn't die from ram usage.

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
 Maybe when koans wouldn't work on my computer. I felt like throwing it out the window. Took a breath, apologised to the device, "we, the humans, are at fault" and I tried repeating steps- but I still have not overcome this but I'm planning on asking someone for a tip on how to use powershell.
 

### What is an IDE?
 An IDE or an integrated development environment is a software suite that consists of tools to develop and test software applications.

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge? Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
 I was recovering from a concussion so I wasn't there for the Marshmallow Challenge but we did something similar in high school PE. I was in a team with Japanese exchange students(relevant information) competing with my classmates. And I learned a lot about my shortcomings. Even though I was in charge, we won because of teamwork, 100% and I would have lost alone or if they listened to everything I said. We were given just a few inches of tape, paper and straws to build a structure that can carry a marshmallow. I came up with the foundation design but turns out that I was impatient and unrefined. I just wanted to get it done as soon as possible that I was haphazard with the tape and alignment. But my teammates showed "Kaizen", they mindfully used each resource and aligned everything carefully and that made our building strong and tall. The benefit of them using their time like that, outweighed the cost of finishing early. At the time I felt they were wasting time because I felt each second ticking by but actually the bigger picture is that the nurture they put in made it strong and lead to no mistakes that needed even more time to fix. This challenge is surprisingly philosophical.


### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
 In general, I think keeping up with the different things that go on all the time. It's hard for me to keep track on what I should be learning in the course when I can't figure out the main learning objectives of the week. The hardest moment was figuring out how to do the coding on my own like the koans. But it may be because I missed the lecture from week 5...

### What is OOP?
 Object-oriented programming is a computer programming style that relies on identificaton of classes of objects linked with their method.
 It has 4 principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
 I don't incorporate the module content as much, I think I have problems figuring out which ones to focus on per week and they are tedious.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
 tedious is: looking for a curated place with a cohesive and tailored content related to the course modules, always clicking on links and looking for supplemental resources, to the point it doesn't feel supplemental, it's the bulk of the time, always looking for answers for everything and asking everyone else when you want to take a break from tediousness of constant research. I should borrow "Coding for Dummies" alongside "Meditation for Dummies" (paperback versions) and drink 5 cans of V.

### What is polymorphism?
 It is a core concept of OOP. It means a single function or class method can have multiple uses. E.g. A Python child class has methods with the same name as the parent class.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
 One time after class, I was walking alone to the train and I just blurted out "Your code is trash." I didn't realise it's been bothering me subconciously to the point it surfaced. Yes, the voice had a point and my code is trash, but it's <em>my</em> trash. And it is my precious trash. Might as well befriend the voice.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
 MVP stands for minimum viable product, it is a development technique where a new product is introduced to the market with basic features but enough to get the attention of the consumers. The final product is released after getting sufficient feedback from initial users.
 
 **6 year old version:** When mommy cooks your favourite, PASTA, and it's still in the pan, and she gives you a spoonful of pasta to eat, and she asks you: <em>"Is it yummy?"</em>, before putting it on a big plate with some extra cheese and salad and everyone sits at the big table where everyone sits down and eats the pasta together.

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
 hardest problem I've solved so far in the course would be if I ever solved how to get koans to work, but I guess how I struggled to convert my f-strings.

### What is pair programming?
  It is an agile software development technique in which 2 programmers work at one workstation. The driver writes code while the navigator reviews each line of code and they switch roles frequently.
 
 I didn't have a pair to work with and I truly realised how helpful it is to have a navigator/observer. I wrote the code for the first task for dog years and I couldn't get it to run properly if the human year input was 1 or 2, and I kept overthinking it the more I tried to fix it and it wouldn't work. I kept escalating it. Turns out I didn't have to add anything to the code, I already had everything, I just needed to replace some code with the variable that I have already assigned. The simplest answer. And I didn't see it until Ying came and sat with me to fix it. We didn't have time to work on the second task together but she gave me a link to an example I can try follow. I still couldn't get it to work because I wanted February to have both 28 and 29. But I really tried to make an array with a code that can retrieve the information.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
 I really want to learn to understand how basic coding rules work and how to achieve them without overcomplicating them. I really want to learn how to code things by myself. I want to be able to develop content that might help me or people I know, like creating features or extensions that can help colour-blind people to navigate through apps and the internet easier. I carry the gene for colour blindness, might as well plan ahead.

### What is conscious listening?
 conscious listening is listening without our own filters and biases affecting what we're processing; with the pure intention of understanding.

### What is a variable?
 is a symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used. Variables represent all kinds of data, including boolean, names, integers, array etc depending on the programming language that supports them.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
 I want to learn JavaScript. So I can finally get the jokes on reddit in r/ProgrammerHumor, and also because I think it would help me create web content.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
 One time someone held the elevator door for me to get on. Usually people just go.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Programming is when you ask the computer to do something but you have to figure out how to ask it in the way it wants to be asked.
 
### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
 The learning how to code in Python part. It made me feel very, very stupid. But I just try to remember that I'm still learning.

### What is a fixed mindset?
 A fixed mindset is when people believe their traits such as talent and intelligence is fixed and they actively believe it can't be grown or developed through effort.

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
 I picked up some trash on the ground near the classroom. It wasn't for anyone specific but Jesus is always watching. (And I used to work as a cleaner so I felt bad for the cleaners that come in at night.) But in personal life, I try to take care of my brothers as much as I can.

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?
 I've done mindfulness on my own, just listing things I'm grateful for but I have never heard of attention training.

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
 I always persevere, my problem is that I am not very forgiving to myself.
